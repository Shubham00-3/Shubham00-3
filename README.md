# 👋 Hi, I'm Shubham Gangwar (@Shubham00-3)

## 🧠 AI Engineering Enthusiast | Building Intelligent Document Systems

I'm on a journey to master AI engineering through hands-on projects, with a special focus on:
- 📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
- 📄 Legal document analysis and processing
- 🤖 Multi-agent AI systems

## 🔭 Current Projects

### RAG-based Question Answering System
- Building a simple yet powerful RAG QA system using single text file input
- Implementing vector embeddings for semantic search
- Exploring different retrieval methods to optimize answer accuracy
- Developing a clean, intuitive interface for natural language queries

### Legal Document Analyzer for India
- Creating a specialized system for Indian legal documents
- Developing document parsing capabilities for various legal formats
- Implementing entity extraction for key legal concepts and clauses
- Building multi-agent systems for complex document analysis
- Working with vector databases for efficient information retrieval

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python
- **ML/AI**: LangChain, HuggingFace Transformers, OpenAI API
- **Vector Databases**: Chroma, FAISS
- **Deployment**: FastAPI, Streamlit
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub

## 📚 Learning Path

I'm following a project-based learning approach to AI engineering, starting with the fundamentals and gradually tackling more complex challenges:

1. ✅ Understanding vector embeddings and similarity search
2. ✅ Building basic RAG systems
3. 🔄 Implementing document processing pipelines
4. 🔄 Developing multi-agent architectures
5. 🔜 Optimizing for specialized domains (legal tech)
6. 🔜 Scaling and production deployment
